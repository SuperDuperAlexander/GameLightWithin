 * The guide: a small light that travels with the player.

 * She is never a face and never a body. What she looks like is a reading of
 * how far the player has come: she starts small and cold, and she grows and
 * warms with the light they carry and with the colour returning to the
 * valley. Nothing about her has to be explained, because there is nothing
 * to read — only something to notice.
 *
 * How she moves is most of her character. She circles slowly, hangs back
 * when the player sets off and catches up afterwards, and drifts in close
 * when they stand still. She is never exactly where she was put; she is
 * always arriving.
