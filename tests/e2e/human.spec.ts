 * The valley is one open place. A player may reach any part of it in any
 * order, so no mechanic may be gated on how far they have come.
 *
 * This is a regression test. The fog, the seed and the bridge all used to be
 * gated on the scene number, and the scene number only moved when the *hidden*
 * second spring was emptied. A player who walked straight past that spring
 * found a fog that did nothing, and with it no transform, no seed and no
 * bridge: everything except breathing looked unimplemented.
